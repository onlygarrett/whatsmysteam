# whatsmysteam

Script to query your machine and print out what you currently have installed by steam

> I currently only created small scripts for Linux bash shell and Powershell but might add more in the future.

### Usage

Bash shell:

```
$ ./scripts/linux/whatsmysteam.sh
```

Powershell:

```
$ ./scripts/windows/whatsmysteam.sh
```

### Note

I did notice that when testing on my larger machine that some searches where taking a while so until I come back and optimize it some machines might take some time.
